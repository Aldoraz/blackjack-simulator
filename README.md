# Blackjack Simulator

A Python-based blackjack simulator that allows you to play multiple hands of blackjack. 
It follows standard rules with following distinctions:
- The dealer does **not hit on soft 17** (dealer stands on any 17)
- There is no payout or money system whatsoever. Win or Loose.
- Hit and Stand are the only available options.

## Features

- Play a game of blackjack.
- Automatic checking for blackjack on initial hands.
- Simulate multiple games with consistent game logic.
- Includes unit tests to verify gameplay functions.

## Planned

- **Multiple Decks**: Option to play with multiple decks (e.g., 2, 4, 6 decks) shuffled together.
- **Simulation Mode**: Implement a mode to run thousands of hands automatically for statistical analysis (e.g., to determine the frequency of "doomed" hands where the player looses no matter the strategy).
- **Statistical Variations**: Explore how gameplay changes with different deck sizes, rules, or multiple players.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blackjack-simulator.git
